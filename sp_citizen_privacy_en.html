    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>US Citizenship Test Prep</strong> ("we," "our," or "the App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

    <h3>Analytics Information</h3>

        This includes anonymous data such as:
    </p>

        <li>Feature usage (which chapters are most studied, which modes are used)</li>
        <li>Device type and OS version (for compatibility testing)</li>
        <li>Crash reports (to fix bugs and improve stability)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>This analytics data is completely anonymous</strong> and cannot be used to identify you personally.
        We use this information solely to improve the app experience.
    </p>

        <li>Show you your performance statistics and improvement over time</li>
        <li>Allow you to resume your studies where you left off</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>

    <p>The only third-party service we may use is Firebase Analytics for anonymous usage statistics, as described above.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data is stored locally on your device using industry-standard SQLite database encryption.

        <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can disable analytics in your device settings if you prefer not to send anonymous usage data</li>
    </ul>
