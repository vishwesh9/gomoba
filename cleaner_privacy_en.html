        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 12, 2025</p>

        <p>At Swipe Photo Cleaner, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application. Please read this policy carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Key Privacy Principle:</strong> Your photos never leave your device. We do not upload, store, or transmit your photos to our servers or any third-party servers. All photo processing happens locally on your device.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Photos and Media (Local Processing Only)</h3>
        <p>The App requires access to your device's photo library to provide its core functionality. When you grant photo library permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photo Metadata:</strong> We access photo metadata including filename, file size, creation date, modification date, and dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>EXIF Data:</strong> Camera model, location data (if embedded in photos), and other technical information</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Content:</strong> For AI-powered features (blur detection, duplicate detection), we analyze photo content using on-device machine learning</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> All photo processing is performed locally on your device. Your photos are NEVER uploaded to our servers, cloud storage, or shared with third parties. We have no access to your actual photo files.
        </div>

        <h3>1.2 Usage Analytics</h3>

        </ul>

        <h3>1.5 Local Storage Data</h3>
