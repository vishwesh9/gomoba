        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 12, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to Swipe Photo Cleaner. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Swipe Photo Cleaner mobile application (the "App") operated by vishwesh789 ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Please read these Terms carefully before using the App. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.
        </div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using Swipe Photo Cleaner, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are using the App on behalf of an organization, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use this App. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement. If you are under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal guardian's permission to use the App.</p>

        <h2>3. License to Use</h2>
        <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use the App on your personal mobile device solely for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Restrictions</h3>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App</li>
            <li>Remove any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices from the App</li>
            <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of these Terms</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any portion of the App or its systems</li>
            <li>Use the App in any manner that could damage, disable, or impair the App</li>
            <li>Distribute, sell, lease, rent, or sublicense the App to third parties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Your Content and Photos</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Photo Ownership</h3>
        <p>You retain all rights, title, and ownership to your photos and any other content you process through the App. We do not claim any ownership rights to your photos.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Local Processing</h3>
        <p>The App processes all photos locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or transmit your photos to our servers or any third-party servers. All photo analysis, categorization, and organization occur entirely on your device.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Photo Library Access</h3>
        <p>The App requires access to your device's photo library to function. By granting this permission, you authorize the App to read, analyze, and modify photos in your library as directed by you through the App's features.</p>

        <h2>5. Photo Deletion and Recovery</h2>

        <h3>5.1 30-Day Trash Period</h3>
        <p>When you mark photos for deletion in the App, they are moved to a "Trash" folder and retained for 30 days. During this period, you can restore deleted photos at any time.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Permanent Deletion</h3>
        <p>After 30 days in the Trash folder, photos are permanently deleted from your device and cannot be recovered. You may also manually trigger permanent deletion at any time through the App's "Empty Trash" feature.</p>

        <h3>5.3 No Liability for Deletions</h3>
        <p>You acknowledge that once photos are permanently deleted, they cannot be recovered. We are not responsible for any loss of photos resulting from your use of the deletion features, whether accidental or intentional.</p>

        <div class="important">
            <strong>WARNING:</strong> Always ensure you have backups of important photos before using deletion features. We strongly recommend using cloud backup services (iCloud, Google Photos, etc.) to protect your photos.
        </div>

        <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Free and Premium Features</h3>
        <p>The App offers both free and premium features. Premium features require an active subscription, which may be offered on a weekly or annual basis.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Managing Subscriptions</h3>

        <h3>6.4 Refunds</h3>
        <p>All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Refund requests must be submitted directly to Apple or Google according to their respective refund policies. We do not have the ability to process refunds directly.</p>

        <h3>6.5 Free Trials</h3>
        <p>We may offer free trial periods for premium subscriptions. If you do not cancel before the trial period ends, you will be automatically charged for the subscription.</p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App integrates with the following third-party services:</p>

            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For subscription management</li>

        <h3>9.3 Limitation of Liability</h3>

        <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
